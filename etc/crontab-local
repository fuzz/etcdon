# Example local crontab. I run my daily backup five minutes after noon because
# an incredibly loud emergency air horn named Hank is tested every day at noon
# a block away from my house, signaling lunchtime to me like Fred Flintsone.
# This way the backups run while I'm away from my computer for lunch. Yabba
# dabba do. Cleanup happens Wednesdays at 25 minutes past noon.
