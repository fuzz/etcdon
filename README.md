# etcdon

These are YAML-free tools for managing Mastodon. The scripts themselves are
POSIX shell but they do rely on They are written against the
Digital Ocean one-click Mastodon install and may need to be modified for other
installations.

## Configuration

You do not need to set `DON_PATH` if you install etcdon in `~/.config/etcdon`,
otherwise set it to the directory in which you do have etcdon installed.

Set `DON_HOST` to the IP address of your Mastodon server.

## Tuning

The official documentation is
[here](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/scaling/).

[This
article](https://nora.codes/post/scaling-mastodon-in-the-face-of-an-exodus/) is
very helpful but mostly focused on Docker.

### Environment variables

These are the relevant tuning knobs.

```
DB_POOL
MAX_THREADS
PUMA_MAX_THREADS  # you probably don't need this
RAILS_MAX_THREADS # you probably don't need this
STREAMING_CLUSTER_NUM
WEB_CONCURRENCY
```

These are from the [Digital Ocean
1-Click](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/mastodon) droplet, version
3.5.3--other installations may be different. As you can see, `DB_POOL` is set
by `mastodon-sidekiq.service` and `STREAMING_CLUSTER_NUM` by
`mastodon-streaming.service`.

```
app/lib/redis_configuration.rb:
def pool_size
  if Sidekiq.server?
    Sidekiq.options[:concurrency]
  else
    ENV['MAX_THREADS'] || 5
  end
end
