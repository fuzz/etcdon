# etcdon

etcdon is a tool for managing Mastodon. The scripts are POSIX shell but etcdon
itself is not POSIX compliant as it relies on tools like rsync(1). etcdon is
written against the [Digital Ocean 1-click Mastodon
install](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/mastodon), currently version
3.5.3, and may need modification for other installations.

Please note etcdon at this time etcdon is a work in progress, meaning I will
close any Issues opened without addressing them and, while I might accept a PR,
I also might not. If and when I make a release of etcdon then Issues and PRs
will be welcomed.

etcdon is MIT licensed so you can fork it and do as you please.

## Configuration

You do not need to set `DON_PATH` if you install etcdon in `~/.config/etcdon`,
otherwise set it to the directory in which you do have etcdon installed.

Set `DON_HOST` to the IP address of your Mastodon server.

## Tuning

The official documentation is
[here](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/scaling/).

[This
article](https://nora.codes/post/scaling-mastodon-in-the-face-of-an-exodus/) is
very helpful but mostly focused on Docker.

### Environment variables

These are the relevant tuning knobs:

```
DB_POOL
MAX_THREADS
PUMA_MAX_THREADS  # you probably don't need this
RAILS_MAX_THREADS # you probably don't need this
STREAMING_CLUSTER_NUM
WEB_CONCURRENCY
```

The below are from the [Digital Ocean 1-Click Mastodon
install](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/mastodon), version
3.5.3--other installations may differ. As you can see, systemd(1) sets
`DB_POOL` with `mastodon-sidekiq.service` and `STREAMING_CLUSTER_NUM` with
`mastodon-streaming.service`.

```
app/lib/redis_configuration.rb:
def pool_size
  if Sidekiq.server?
    Sidekiq.options[:concurrency]
  else
    ENV['MAX_THREADS'] || 5
  end
end

config/database.yml: pool: <%= ENV["DB_POOL"] || ENV['MAX_THREADS'] || 5 %>

config/puma.rb: threads_count = ENV.fetch('MAX_THREADS') { 5 }.to_i

config/puma.rb: workers: ENV.fetch('WEB_CONCURRENCY') { 2 }

config/sidekiq.yml:
:concurrency: 5
:queues:
  - [default, 6]
  - [push, 4]
  - [mailers, 2]
  - [pull]
  - [scheduler]

streaming/index.js:
const numWorkers = +process.env.STREAMING_CLUSTER_NUM || (env === 'development' ? 1 : Math.max(os.cpus().length - 1, 1));

vendor/bundle/ruby/3.0.0/gems/puma-5.6.4/lib/puma/configuration.rb:

          symbolized_options[:size]
        elsif Sidekiq.server?
          # Give ourselves plenty of connections.  pool is lazy
          # so we won't create them until we need them.
          Sidekiq.options[:concurrency] + 5
        elsif ENV["RAILS_MAX_THREADS"]
          Integer(ENV["RAILS_MAX_THREADS"])
        else
          5
        end
```
