# etcdon

There are tools for managing Mastodon. They are written against the
Digital Ocean one-click Mastodon install and may need to be modified for other
installations.

## Configuration for bin/

You do not need to set `DON_PATH` if you install Etcdon in `~/.config/etcdon`,
otherwise set it to the directory in which you do have it installed.

Set `DON_HOST` to the IP address of your Mastodon server.
